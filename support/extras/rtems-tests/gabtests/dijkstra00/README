This test application is conditioned to do the following:
  1) Create some periodic tasks according to the params.h settings
  2) Create some dijkstra aperiodic tasks according to the params.h settings
  3) Start all tasks.
  4) The last dijkstra task to finish will terminate the test.

The intent is to run a similar amount of background work, while periodic 
(critical) real-time tasks are running some synthetic workload.

The characteristics of the periodic tasks can be exchanged, for the basic 
test I use some CPU bound tasks.
