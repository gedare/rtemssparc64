rtems-patches

This directory contains patches that might need to be applied to the 
RTEMS CVS repository in order to get sparc64 working.

rtems-sparc64.diff - This patch is optional, and adds the print statements 
for START_TOKEN and END_TOKEN, which are used by some of the simics scripts
to control when output is captured while running RTEMS tests.

objectsextend.diff - This patch corrects an alignment issue caused during 
system initialization.  See RTEMS PR 1560: 
https://www.rtems.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1560
