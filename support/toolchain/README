toolchain

This directory contains scripts to help build the RTEMS sparc64 compiler 
from sources.  The rtemspatches/ directory should be localized with symlinks 
instead of empty files that point to the appropriate patch to apply for each 
of the binutils, gcc, and newlib sources.

Make sure that the version numbers in the .sh file match the patch and the 
expected version for the RTEMS being built.
