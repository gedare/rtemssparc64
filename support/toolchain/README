toolchain/

Note: The RTEMS Yum repository contains the up-to-date stock toolchain.

This directory contains scripts to help build the RTEMS sparc64 compiler 
from sources.  The rtemspatches/ directory should be localized with symlinks 
instead of empty files that point to the appropriate patch to apply for each 
of the binutils, gcc, and newlib sources.

Make sure that the version numbers in the .sh file match the patch and the 
expected version for the RTEMS being built.

Note that these scripts only build binutils and gcc with newlib. Other 
up-to-date tools may need to be built separately, for example to build 
gcc you may need to build gmp, mpfr, and mpc.  Also, up-to-date versions
of autoconf and automake may need to be built.  We do not have automated 
scripts for these tools yet.
