initial version: Nov 27  1991

This directory contains several implementations in different languages
of the DeltaBlue incremental dataflow constraint solver described in
UW CS TR 91-08-12 ``Using Constraints for User Interface
Construction'' by John Maloney.  Each implementation is in a separate
subdirectory, named with the name of the language: C-DEC, C-SUN4,
Smalltalk, common-lisp.

The C-DEC and C-SUN4 subdirectories contain almost-identical
implementations of the algorithm in the C language, developed on a
Decstation and a Sun 4.  There were some minor differences betweeen
the C compilers on the two machines that required a few changes.  The
major difference, however, is that the Sun 4 version preallocates and
re-uses temporary storage needed by the benchmarks.  Similar changes
could also be made to the Decstation version.

Warning: It appears that the C implementations of DeltaBlue can loop
infinitely when compiled on an IRIS (and perhaps other machines).  Here is
the fix:

Only a triffle, but DeltaBlue won't work on many Linux machine due to the
vague def. of char.  here is a simple fix (-fsigned-char will also fix,
but that can upset linking etc):

bash-2.04$ diff Constraints.h ../delta/Delta-C/Constraints.h
13c13
<   signed char		walkStrength;
---
>   char		walkStrength;
21,25c21,25
<   signed char		strength;
<   signed char		whichMethod;
<   signed char		methodCount;
<   signed char		varCount;
<   signed char		methodOuts[7];
---
>   char		strength;
>   char		whichMethod;
>   char		methodCount;
>   char		varCount;
>   char		methodOuts[7];
