This is the BSP for Cogent Computer System's KIT637_V6. This is an
updated version of the CSB337 board with a number of optional peripheals.

This KIT is implemented by CSB637 single board computer using the 
Atmel AT91RM9200 CPU and the CSB937 target main board. It uses an 
Optrex LCD (T-51750AA, 640x480) and Touchscreen (not supported in this
BSP). The IDE and USB (host and device) interfaces are also not supported.
The SD and Compact Flash cards drivers are still under development. 

The differences in the CSB637 single board computer are very slight but 
important:
