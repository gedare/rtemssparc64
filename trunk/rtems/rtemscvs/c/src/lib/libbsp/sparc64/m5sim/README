Simple BSP for the m5 SPARC_SE Simulator, which simulates an UltraSparc T1
with system call emulation.

Simulator Invocation
====================

Status
======

* Due to limitations of the simulator you will only be able to run
applications which do not try using any priviliged registers or instructions.

Currently, this excludes all applications, which apply timers and serial 
devices, i.e. almost any real world application.
