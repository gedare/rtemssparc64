@chapter Texas Instruments C3x/C4x Specific Information

The Real Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS)
is designed to be portable across multiple processor
architectures.  However, the nature of real-time systems makes
it essential that the application designer understand certain
processor dependent implementation details.  These processor
dependencies include calling convention, board support package
issues, interrupt processing, exact RTEMS memory requirements,
performance data, header files, and the assembly language
interface to the executive.

This document discusses the Texas Instrument C3x/C4x
architecture dependencies in this port of RTEMS.  The C3x/C4x
family has a wide variety of CPU models within it.  The following
CPU model numbers could be supported by this port:

@itemize
@item C30 - TMSXXX
@item C31 - TMSXXX
@item C32 - TMSXXX
@item C41 - TMSXXX
@item C44 - TMSXXX
@end itemize

Initiially, this port does not include full support for C4x models.
Primarily, the C4x specific implementations of interrupt flag and
mask management routines have not been completed.

It is highly recommended that the RTEMS application developer obtain
and become familiar with the documentation for the processor being
used as well as the documentation for the family as a whole.

@section CPU Model Dependent Features


Microprocessors are generally classified into
families with a variety of CPU models or implementations within
that family.  Within a processor family, there is a high level
of binary compatibility.  This family may be based on either an
architectural specification or on maintaining compatibility with
a popular processor.  Recent microprocessor families such as the
SPARC or PowerPC are based on an architectural specification
which is independent or any particular CPU model or
implementation.  Older families such as the M68xxx and the iX86
evolved as the manufacturer strived to produce higher
performance processor models which maintained binary
compatibility with older models.

RTEMS takes advantage of the similarity of the
various models within a CPU family.  Although the models do vary
in significant ways, the high level of compatibility makes it
possible to share the bulk of the CPU dependent executive code
across the entire family.  Each processor family supported by
RTEMS has a list of features which vary between CPU models
within a family.  For example, the most common model dependent
feature regardless of CPU family is the presence or absence of a
floating point unit or coprocessor.  When defining the list of
features present on a particular CPU model, one simply notes
that floating point hardware is or is not present and defines a
single constant appropriately.  Conditional compilation is
utilized to include the appropriate source code for this CPU
model's feature set.  It is important to note that this means
that RTEMS is thus compiled using the appropriate feature set
and compilation flags optimal for this CPU model used.  The
alternative would be to generate a binary which would execute on
all family members using only the features which were always
present.

This chapter presents the set of features which vary
across the various implementations of the C3x/C4x architecture
that are of importance to rtems.
the set of cpu model feature macros are defined in the file
cpukit/score/cpu/c4x/rtems/score/c4x.h and are based upon
the particular cpu model defined in the bsp's custom configuration
file as well as the compilation command line.

@subsection CPU Model Name

The macro @code{CPU_MODEL_NAME} is a string which designates
the name of this cpu model.  for example, for the c32
processor, this macro is set to the string "c32".

@subsection Floating Point Unit

The Texas Instruments C3x/C4x family makes little distinction
between the various cpu registers.  Although floating point
operations may only be performed on a subset of the cpu registers,
these same registers may be used for normal integer operations.
as a result of this, this port of rtems makes no distinction 
between integer and floating point contexts.  The routine
@code{_CPU_Context_switch} saves all of the registers that
comprise a task's context.  the routines that initialize,
save, and restore floating point contexts are not present
in this port.

Moreover, there is no floating point context pointer and
the code in @code{_Thread_Dispatch} that manages the
floating point context switching process is disabled
on this port.

This not only simplifies the port, it also speeds up context
switches by reducing the code involved and reduces the code 
space footprint of the executive on the Texas Instruments
C3x/C4x.

@section Calling Conventions


Each high-level language compiler generates
subroutine entry and exit code based upon a set of rules known
as the compiler's calling convention.   These rules address the
following issues:

@itemize @bullet
@item register preservation and usage
@item parameter passing
@item call and return mechanism
@end itemize

A compiler's calling convention is of importance when
interfacing to subroutines written in another language either
assembly or high-level.  Even when the high-level language and
target processor are the same, different compilers may use
different calling conventions.  As a result, calling conventions
are both processor and compiler dependent.

The GNU Compiler Suite follows the same calling conventions
as the Texas Instruments toolset.

@subsection Processor Background

The TI C3x and C4x processors support a simple yet
effective call and return mechanism.  A subroutine is invoked
via the branch to subroutine (@code{XXX}) or the jump to subroutine
(@code{XXX}) instructions.  These instructions push the return address
on the current stack.  The return from subroutine (@code{XXX})
instruction pops the return address off the current stack and
transfers control to that instruction.  It is important to
note that the call and return mechanism for the C3x/C4x does not
automatically save or restore any registers.  It is the
responsibility of the high-level language compiler to define the
register preservation and usage convention.

XXX other supplements may have "is is".

@subsection Calling Mechanism

All subroutines are invoked using either a @code{XXX}
or @code{XXX} instruction and return to the user application via the
@code{XXX} instruction.

@subsection Register Usage

XXX

As discussed above, the @code{XXX} and @code{XXX} instructions do
not automatically save any registers.  Subroutines use the registers
@b{D0}, @b{D1}, @b{A0}, and @b{A1} as scratch registers.  These registers are
not preserved by subroutines therefore, the contents of
these registers should not be assumed upon return from any subroutine
call including but not limited to an RTEMS directive.

The GNU and Texas Instruments compilers follow the same conventions
for register usage.

@subsection Parameter Passing

Both the GNU and Texas Instruments compilers support two conventions
for passing parameters to subroutines.  Arguments may be passed in
memory on the stack or in registers.

@subsubsection Parameters Passed in Memory

When passing parameters on the stack, the calling convention assumes
that arguments are placed on the current stack before the subroutine
is invoked via the @code{XXX} instruction.  The first argument is
assumed to be closest to the return address on the stack.  This means
that the first argument of the C calling sequence is pushed last.  The
following pseudo-code illustrates the typical sequence used to call a
subroutine with three (3) arguments:

@example
@group
push third argument
push second argument
push first argument
invoke subroutine
remove arguments from the stack
@end group
@end example

The arguments to RTEMS are typically pushed onto the
stack using a @code{sti} instruction with a pre-incremented stack
pointer as the destination.  These arguments must be removed
from the stack after control is returned to the caller.  This
removal is typically accomplished by subtracting the size of the
argument list in words from the current stack pointer.

@c XXX XXX instruction .. XXX should be code format.

With the GNU Compiler Suite, parameter passing via the 
stack is selected by invoking the compiler with the
@code{-mmemparm XXX} argument.  This argument must be
included when linking the application in order to
ensure that support libraries also compiled assuming
parameter passing via the stack are used.  The default
parameter passing mechanism is XXX.

When this parameter passing mecahanism is selected, the @code{XXX}
symbol is predefined by the C and C++ compilers
and the @code{XXX} symbol is predefined by the assembler.
This behavior is the same for the GNU and Texas Instruments
toolsets.  RTEMS uses these predefines to determine how
parameters are passed in to those C3x/C4x specific routines
that were written in assembly language.

@subsubsection Parameters Passed in Registers

When passing parameters via registers, the calling convention assumes
that the arguments are placed in particular registers based upon
their position and data type before the subroutine is invoked via
the @code{XXX} instruction.  

The following pseudo-code illustrates
the typical sequence used to call a subroutine with three (3) arguments:

@example
@group
move third argument to XXX
move second argument to XXX
move first argument to XXX
invoke subroutine
@end group
@end example

With the GNU Compiler Suite, parameter passing via 
registers is selected by invoking the compiler with the
@code{-mregparm XXX} argument.  This argument must be
included when linking the application in order to
ensure that support libraries also compiled assuming
parameter passing via the stack are used.  The default
parameter passing mechanism is XXX.

When this parameter passing mecahanism is selected, the @code{XXX}
symbol is predefined by the C and C++ compilers
and the @code{XXX} symbol is predefined by the assembler.
This behavior is the same for the GNU and Texas Instruments
toolsets.  RTEMS uses these predefines to determine how
parameters are passed in to those C3x/C4x specific routines
that were written in assembly language.

@subsection User-Provided Routines

All user-provided routines invoked by RTEMS, such as
user extensions, device drivers, and MPCI routines, must also
adhere to these calling conventions.

@section Memory Model


A processor may support any combination of memory
models ranging from pure physical addressing to complex demand
paged virtual memory systems.  RTEMS supports a flat memory
model which ranges contiguously over the processor's allowable
address space.  RTEMS does not support segmentation or virtual
memory of any kind.  The appropriate memory model for RTEMS
provided by the targeted processor and related characteristics
of that model are described in this chapter.

@subsection Byte Addressable versus Word Addressable

Processor in the Texas Instruments C3x/C4x family are 
word addressable.  This is in sharp contrast to CISC and
RISC processors that are typically byte addressable.  In a word
addressable architecture, each address points not to an
8-bit byte or octet but to 32 bits.

On first glance, byte versus word addressability does not
sound like a problem but in fact, this issue can result in
subtle problems in high-level language software that is ported
to a word addressable processor family.  The following is a 
list of the commonly encountered problems:

@table @b

@item String Optimizations
Although each character in a string occupies a single address just
as it does on a byte addressable CPU, each character occupies
32 rather than 8 bits.  The most significant 24 bytes are 
of each address are ignored.  This in and of itself does not
cause problems but it violates the assumption that two 
adjacent characters in a string have no intervening bits.
This assumption is often implicit in string and memory comparison
routines that are optimized to compare 4 adjacent characters
with a word oriented operation.  This optimization is 
invalid on word addressable processors.

@item Sizeof
The C operation @code{sizeof} returns very different results
on the C3x/C4x than on traditional RISC/CISC processors. 
The @code{sizeof(char)}, @code{sizeof(short)}, and @code{sizeof(int)}
are all 1 since each occupies a single addressable unit that is
thirty-two bits wide.  On most thirty-two bit processors,
@code{sizeof(char} is one, @code{sizeof(short)} is two,
and @code{sizeof(int)} is four.  Just as software makes assumptions
about the sizes of the primitive data types has problems
when ported to a sixty-four bit architecture, these same
assumptions cause problems on the C3x/C4x.

@item Alignment
Since each addressable unit is thirty-two bit wide, there
are no alignment restrictions.  The native integer type
need only be aligned on a "one unit" boundary not a "four
unit" boundary as on numerous other processors.

@end table

@subsection Flat Memory Model

XXX check actual bits on the various processor families.

The XXX family supports a flat 32-bit address
space with addresses ranging from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (4
gigabytes).  Each address is represented by a 32-bit value and
is byte addressable.  The address may be used to reference a
single byte, word (2-bytes), or long word (4 bytes).  Memory
accesses within this address space are performed in big endian
fashion by the processors in this family.

@subsection Compiler Memory Models

The Texas Instruments C3x/C4x processors include a Data Page
(@code{dp}) register that logically is a base address.  The
@code{dp} register allows the use of shorter offsets in
instructions.  Up to 64K words may be addressed using
offsets from the @code{dp} register.  In order to address
words not addressable based on the current value of
@code{dp}, the register must be loaded with a different
value.

The @code{dp} register is managed automatically by
the high-level language compilers.
The various compilers for this processor family support
two memory models that manage the @code{dp} register
in very different manners.  The large and small memory
models are discussed in the following sections.

NOTE: The C3x/C4x port of RTEMS has been written
so that it should support either memory model.
However, it has only been tested using the
large memory model.

@subsubsection Small Memory Model

The small memory model is the simplest and most
efficient.  However, it includes a limitation that
make it inappropriate for numerous applications.  The
small memory model assumes that the application needs
to access no more than 64K words. Thus the @code{dp} 
register can be loaded at application start time 
and never reloaded.  Thus the compiler will not
even generate instructions to load the @code{dp}.

This can significantly reduce the code space
required by an application but the application
is limited in the amount of data it can access.

With the GNU Compiler Suite, small memory model is 
selected by invoking the compiler with either the 
@code{-msmall} or @code{-msmallmemoryXXX} argument.
This argument must be included when linking the application
in order to ensure that support libraries also compiled
for the large memory model are used.  
The default memory model is XXX.

When this memory model is selected, the @code{XXX}
symbol is predefined by the C and C++ compilers
and the @code{XXX} symbol is predefined by the assembler.
This behavior is the same for the GNU and Texas Instruments
toolsets.  RTEMS uses these predefines to determine the proper handling
of the @code{dp} register in those C3x/C4x specific routines
that were written in assembly language.

@subsubsection Large Memory Model

The large memory model is more complex and less efficient
than the small memory model.  However, it removes the
64K uninitialized data restriction from applications.
The @code{dp} register is reloaded automatically
by the compiler each time data is accessed.  This leads
to an increase in the code space requirements for the
application but gives it access to much more data space.

With the GNU Compiler Suite, large memory model is 
selected by invoking the compiler with either the 
@code{-mlarge} or @code{-mlargememoryXXX} argument.
This argument must be included when linking the application
in order to ensure that support libraries also compiled
for the large memory model are used.
The default memory model is XXX.

When this memory model is selected, the @code{XXX}
symbol is predefined by the C and C++ compilers
and the @code{XXX} symbol is predefined by the assembler.
This behavior is the same for the GNU and Texas Instruments
toolsets.  RTEMS uses these predefines to determine the proper handling
of the @code{dp} register in those C3x/C4x specific routines
that were written in assembly language.

@section Interrupt Processing


Different types of processors respond to the
occurrence of an interrupt in its own unique fashion. In
addition, each processor type provides a control mechanism to
allow for the proper handling of an interrupt.  The processor
dependent response to the interrupt modifies the current
execution state and results in a change in the execution stream.
Most processors require that an interrupt handler utilize some
special control mechanisms to return to the normal processing
stream.  Although RTEMS hides many of the processor dependent
details of interrupt processing, it is important to understand
how the RTEMS interrupt manager is mapped onto the processor's
unique architecture. Discussed in this chapter are the XXX's
interrupt response and control mechanisms as they pertain to
RTEMS.

@subsection Vectoring of an Interrupt Handler

Depending on whether or not the particular CPU
supports a separate interrupt stack, the XXX family has two
different interrupt handling models.

@subsubsection Models Without Separate Interrupt Stacks

Upon receipt of an interrupt the XXX family
members without separate interrupt stacks automatically perform
the following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item To Be Written
@end itemize

@subsubsection Models With Separate Interrupt Stacks

Upon receipt of an interrupt the XXX family
members with separate interrupt stacks automatically perform the
following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item saves the current status register (SR),

@item clears the master/interrupt (M) bit of the SR to
indicate the switch from master state to interrupt state,

@item sets the privilege mode to supervisor,

@item suppresses tracing,

@item sets the interrupt mask level equal to the level of the
interrupt being serviced,

@item pushes an interrupt stack frame (ISF), which includes
the program counter (PC), the status register (SR), and the
format/exception vector offset (FVO) word, onto the supervisor
and interrupt stacks,

@item switches the current stack to the interrupt stack and
vectors to an interrupt service routine (ISR).  If the ISR was
installed with the interrupt_catch directive, then the RTEMS
interrupt handler will begin execution.  The RTEMS interrupt
handler saves all registers which are not preserved according to
the calling conventions and invokes the application's ISR.
@end itemize

A nested interrupt is processed similarly by these
CPU models with the exception that only a single ISF is placed
on the interrupt stack and the current stack need not be
switched.

The FVO word in the Interrupt Stack Frame is examined
by RTEMS to determine when an outer most interrupt is being
exited. Since the FVO is used by RTEMS for this purpose, the
user application code MUST NOT modify this field.

The following shows the Interrupt Stack Frame for
XXX CPU models with separate interrupt stacks:

@ifset use-ascii
@example
@group
               +----------------------+
               |    Status Register   | 0x0

@end ifset

@subsection Interrupt Levels

Eight levels (0-7) of interrupt priorities are
supported by XXX family members with level seven (7) being
the highest priority.  Level zero (0) indicates that interrupts
are fully enabled.  Interrupt requests for interrupts with
priorities less than or equal to the current interrupt mask
level are ignored.

Although RTEMS supports 256 interrupt levels, the
XXX family only supports eight.  RTEMS interrupt levels 0
through 7 directly correspond to XXX interrupt levels.  All
other RTEMS interrupt levels are undefined and their behavior is
unpredictable.

@subsection Disabling of Interrupts by RTEMS

During the execution of directive calls, critical
sections of code may be executed.  When these sections are
encountered, RTEMS disables interrupts to level seven (7) before
the execution of this section and restores them to the previous
level upon completion of the section.  RTEMS has been optimized
to insure that interrupts are disabled for less than 
RTEMS_MAXIMUM_DISABLE_PERIOD microseconds on a 
RTEMS_MAXIMUM_DISABLE_PERIOD_MHZ Mhz XXX with 
zero wait states.  These numbers will vary based the 
number of wait states and processor speed present on the target board.
[NOTE:  The maximum period with interrupts disabled is hand calculated.  This
calculation was last performed for Release 
RTEMS_RELEASE_FOR_MAXIMUM_DISABLE_PERIOD.]

Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) cannot be disabled, and
ISRs which execute at this level MUST NEVER issue RTEMS system
calls.  If a directive is invoked, unpredictable results may
occur due to the inability of RTEMS to protect its critical
sections.  However, ISRs that make no system calls may safely
execute as non-maskable interrupts.

@subsection Interrupt Stack

RTEMS allocates the interrupt stack from the
Workspace Area.  The amount of memory allocated for the
interrupt stack is determined by the interrupt_stack_size field
in the CPU Configuration Table.  During the initialization
process, RTEMS will install its interrupt stack.

The XXX port of RTEMS supports a software managed
dedicated interrupt stack on those CPU models which do not
support a separate interrupt stack in hardware.

@section Default Fatal Error Processing


Upon detection of a fatal error by either the
application or RTEMS the fatal error manager is invoked.  The
fatal error manager will invoke the user-supplied fatal error
handlers.  If no user-supplied handlers are configured,  the
RTEMS provided default fatal error handler is invoked.  If the
user-supplied fatal error handlers return to the executive the
default fatal error handler is then invoked.  This chapter
describes the precise operations of the default fatal error
handler.

@subsection Default Fatal Error Handler Operations

The default fatal error handler which is invoked by
the @code{rtems_fatal_error_occurred} directive when there is
no user handler configured or the user handler returns control to
RTEMS.  The default fatal error handler disables processor interrupts,
places the error code in @b{XXX}, and executes a @code{XXX}
instruction to simulate a halt processor instruction.

@section Board Support Packages


An RTEMS Board Support Package (BSP) must be designed
to support a particular processor and target board combination.
This chapter presents a discussion of XXX specific BSP
issues.   For more information on developing a BSP, refer to the
chapter titled Board Support Packages in the RTEMS
Applications User's Guide.

@subsection System Reset

An RTEMS based application is initiated or
re-initiated when the XXX processor is reset.  When the
XXX is reset, the processor performs the following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item The tracing bits of the status register are cleared to
disable tracing.

@item The supervisor interrupt state is entered by setting the
supervisor (S) bit and clearing the master/interrupt (M) bit of
the status register.

@item The interrupt mask of the status register is set to
level 7 to effectively disable all maskable interrupts.

@item The vector base register (VBR) is set to zero.

@item The cache control register (CACR) is set to zero to
disable and freeze the processor cache.

@item The interrupt stack pointer (ISP) is set to the value
stored at vector 0 (bytes 0-3) of the exception vector table
(EVT).

@item The program counter (PC) is set to the value stored at
vector 1 (bytes 4-7) of the EVT.

@item The processor begins execution at the address stored in
the PC.
@end itemize

@subsection Processor Initialization

The address of the application's initialization code
should be stored in the first vector of the EVT which will allow
the immediate vectoring to the application code.  If the
application requires that the VBR be some value besides zero,
then it should be set to the required value at this point.  All
tasks share the same XXX's VBR value.  Because interrupts
are enabled automatically by RTEMS as part of the initialize
executive directive, the VBR MUST be set before this directive
is invoked to insure correct interrupt vectoring.  If processor
caching is to be utilized, then it should be enabled during the
reset application initialization code.

In addition to the requirements described in the
Board Support Packages chapter of the Applications User's
Manual for the reset code which is executed before the call to
initialize executive, the XXX version has the following
specific requirements:

@itemize @bullet
@item Must leave the S bit of the status register set so that
the XXX remains in the supervisor state.

@item Must set the M bit of the status register to remove the
XXX from the interrupt state.

@item Must set the master stack pointer (MSP) such that a
minimum stack size of MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE bytes is provided for
the initialize executive directive.

@item Must initialize the XXX's vector table.
@end itemize

Note that the BSP is not responsible for allocating
or installing the interrupt stack.  RTEMS does this
automatically as part of initialization.  If the BSP does not
install an interrupt stack and -- for whatever reason -- an
interrupt occurs before initialize_executive is invoked, then
the results are unpredictable.
