A lot of explanation needed, will do when known.

The score/cpu/sparc64 contains only code that can execute without accessing 
privileged registers or using privileged instructions. This was done because
the privileged registers differ between the sun4u and sun4v models, and also
to facilitate using the M5 system call emulation simulator with the m5sim BSP.
Currently the m5sim support does not work. The model specific and privileged 
code that would normally be found in score/cpu/sparc64 resides in 
libcpu/sparc64/@RTEMS_CPU_MODEL@/score. This is primarily the interrupt
handling code.
