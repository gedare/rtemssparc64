 *  This include file contains all the constants, structures, and

 *  fire at specified intervals of time.
 *
 *  Directives provided are:
 *
 *     - create a timer
 *     - get an ID of a timer
 *     - delete a timer
 *     - set timer to fire in context of clock tick
 *        - after a number of ticks have passed
 *        - when a specified date and time has been reached
 *     - initiate the timer server task
 *     - set timer to fire in context of the timer server task
 *        - after a number of ticks have passed
 *        - when a specified date and time has been reached
 *     - reset a timer
 *     - cancel a time
